# Global Palette Generation

![bg left opacity:.4](media/tourney.gif)

<!-- GIF or image of an ancient book "the gif specs" -->

## Why?

In order to build any given GIF file, we must comply with the GIF specs. And specs tell us that we must use a maximum of 256 colors.

We can use a default one that has a mediocre representation of _all_ the colors, or we can generate one ourselves. It is not _that_ hard and yields much better results.
